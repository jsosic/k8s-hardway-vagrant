Following kubernetes-the-hard-way and building cluster in Vagrant

## Intro

This is an excercise repo with files and scripts that follow
[Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
guide.

This is my attempt to learn the bootstrap process and individual components of a k8s cluster,
using Vagrant instances.
